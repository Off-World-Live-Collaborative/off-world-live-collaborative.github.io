# Off World Collaborative Home Page

This contains the source code for the page https://off-world-live-collaborative.github.io

## Development

Currently we have no automated build pipeline, but this uses typescript and we
recommend you install `yarn` and run `yarn watch` while working on this repository

That will create a local server as well as auto-recompile the typescript modules
into javascript ESM modules.

Feel free to PR if you notice any issues.

## Features

Currently this only serves to get Twitch bearer tokens for use in the VTuber app
though may expand in future for other functions.
